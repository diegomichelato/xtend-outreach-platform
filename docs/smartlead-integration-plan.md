# Smartlead API Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to integrate Smartlead's API for email campaign management into our existing Xtend Creators platform. This integration will replace our current direct SMTP email sending implementation with Smartlead's managed email infrastructure.

## Benefits of Smartlead Integration
- Improved email deliverability through Smartlead's optimized delivery infrastructure
- Built-in email warm-up functionality
- Automated sending schedule management
- Native open/click/bounce tracking
- Better handling of email sending limits and throttling

## Integration Components

### 1. Authentication
- **Method**: API Key in HTTP Headers
- **Implementation**: Store Smartlead API key in environment variables
- **Header Format**: `Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}`

### 2. Core API Endpoints

#### Campaign Management
- Create campaigns (`POST /campaigns`)
- List campaigns (`GET /campaigns`)
- Get campaign details (`GET /campaigns/{id}`)

#### Lead/Contact Management
- Add leads to campaign (`POST /campaigns/{id}/leads`)
- Upload CSV of leads (`POST /campaigns/{id}/leads/csv`)

#### Email Sending
- Send email via campaign (`POST /campaigns/{id}/send`)
- Track email status (`GET /emails/{id}/status`)

### 3. System Flow Changes

**Current Flow:**
1. Parse CSV contacts
2. Create personalized email content using OpenAI
3. Connect to email accounts via SMTP
4. Send emails directly through SMTP

**New Flow with Smartlead:**
1. Parse CSV contacts (unchanged)
2. Create personalized email content using OpenAI (unchanged)
3. Create campaign in Smartlead via API
4. Upload leads to Smartlead campaign
5. Set personalized content for each lead
6. Activate campaign via Smartlead API
7. Monitor status via Smartlead API

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: API Client Setup
1. Create a `SmartleadApiClient` class to handle authentication and API requests
2. Implement configuration for API key storage (environment variables)
3. Create methods for all required API endpoints
4. Set up proper error handling and response parsing

### Phase 2: Core Integration
1. Extend the contact management system to prepare data for Smartlead
2. Create a campaign management interface for Smartlead campaigns
3. Build an API adapter layer that replaces direct SMTP calls
4. Implement lead upload functionality from CSV

### Phase 3: Email Generation and Personalization
1. Adapt the OpenAI integration to format content for Smartlead
2. Create a preview/approval UI for generated email content
3. Implement lead-specific personalization mapping

### Phase 4: Tracking and Reporting
1. Implement campaign status retrieval
2. Create a dashboard for viewing email open/click/bounce metrics
3. Set up periodic status polling for active campaigns

## Required Environment Variables
- `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY`: API key for authentication with Smartlead
- `SMARTLEAD_API_URL`: Base URL for the Smartlead API (for environment flexibility)

## Technical Considerations
- Rate limiting: Implement proper backoff mechanisms for API requests
- Error handling: Create robust error handling for API responses
- Testing: Create a test mode that validates API calls without sending real emails
- Migration: Provide a transition period where both SMTP and Smartlead methods are available

## UI Changes
1. Add Smartlead configuration settings to the admin panel
2. Create a campaign creation wizard optimized for Smartlead
3. Add email status visualization dashboards
4. Implement campaign management interface

## Data Model Updates
1. Add `smartlead_campaign_id` to campaigns table
2. Add `smartlead_lead_id` to contacts table
3. Add `smartlead_email_id` to emails table
4. Create new table for Smartlead-specific campaign settings

## Testing Strategy
1. Create mock API responses for all Smartlead endpoints
2. Implement a test mode that validates API calls without making actual requests
3. Test end-to-end integration with small sample campaigns
4. Compare deliverability metrics between direct SMTP and Smartlead

## Implementation Sequence
1. Set up Smartlead API client (authentication, basic requests)
2. Implement campaign creation via API
3. Add lead/contact upload functionality
4. Create email content preparation for Smartlead
5. Implement campaign activation
6. Add status tracking and reporting
7. Release with feature flag for gradual rollout

## Security Considerations
- API key must be stored securely (environment variables, not in code)
- All API requests should use HTTPS
- Implement proper error handling for failed authentication
- Consider implementing API key rotation strategy
